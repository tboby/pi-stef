# sf-pair-plan

Create a multi-milestone implementation plan with iterative reviewer approval.

## Prerequisites

- pi-subagents extension installed
- Reviewer model configured (via config, env, or prompt)
- Obra Superpowers skills available to pi: `brainstorming`, `writing-plans` (install from https://github.com/obra/superpowers)

## Process

### Phase 1: Analyze

Explore the codebase and existing patterns. Use `Agent({ agentType: "General" })` to understand the project structure — the default `Explore` agent uses Haiku which is too weak for planning analysis.

### Phase 2: Gather Requirements

Ask questions one at a time using `AskUserQuestion` until the scope is clear. Confirm constraints, success criteria, dependencies, and what is out of scope.

### Phase 3: Resolve Reviewer Model

The tool has already resolved the reviewer model and written `.pi/agents/reviewer.md`. Verify it exists:

```
test -f .pi/agents/reviewer.md
```

If it doesn't exist, stop and ask the user for a reviewer model.

### Phase 4: Design

Load `brainstorming` skill. Present 2-3 approaches and recommend one. Resolve open design questions before the milestone breakdown.

### Phase 5: Plan

Load `writing-plans` skill. Break the work into milestones and bite-sized stories (2-5 min each). Story IDs use `S-101`, `S-102` style.

Each story must be detailed enough for a less intelligent model to follow to the letter.

### Phase 6: Iterative Plan Review

#### Step 1: Write plan to temp file

Write the complete plan to `/tmp/pair-plan-{REVIEW_ID}.md` where REVIEW_ID is a random UUID.

#### Step 2: Spawn reviewer

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "reviewer",
  prompt: "Review the implementation plan at /tmp/pair-plan-{REVIEW_ID}.md. Return exactly the required ## Summary, ## Findings (P0-P3), and ## Verdict structure.",
  description: "Review plan round N"
})
```

#### Step 3: Parse verdict

Scan the response for `VERDICT: APPROVED` (case-insensitive, line must start with `VERDICT:`).

- If found AND no P0/P1/P2 findings → proceed to Phase 7
- If not found OR P0/P1/P2 present → extract findings, fix, rewrite /tmp file, goto Step 2
- If max rounds (10) reached → stop, present outcome to user

### Phase 7: Generate Plan Files

Once the plan is approved:

1. Ensure `ai_plan/` exists in `.gitignore`
2. Create `ai_plan/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`
3. Write using templates from this package's `templates/` directory:
   - `original-plan.md` — raw approved plan
   - `final-transcript.md` — conversation log
   - `milestone-plan.md` — from template
   - `story-tracker.md` — from template
   - `continuation-runbook.md` — from template

### Phase 8: Telegram Notification

If `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are configured, send a completion summary via the Telegram notifier helper.
