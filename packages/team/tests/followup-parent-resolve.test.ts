/**
 * Live failure 2026-05-08:
 *
 * 1. The user passed an absolute path to `sf_team_followup`'s
 *    `parentPlan`. `resolveParentPlan` did `path.join(repoRoot,
 *    PLAN_FOLDER_ROOT, opts.plan)` which silently concatenated the
 *    absolute path INSIDE `<repoRoot>/ai_plan/`, producing a broken
 *    path like `<repoRoot>/ai_plan/Users/.../2026-05-08-...`.
 *
 * 2. After the agent retried with a bare slug, the followup tool
 *    rejected with `workflow metadata for <slug> is owned by
 *    sf_team_auto; sf_team_followup cannot run it`. Followup is
 *    by-design ADDITIVE on top of an existing plan folder, so it
 *    should be allowed to take over from any of the other workflow
 *    tools.
 *
 * Tests:
 *   A) resolveParentPlan accepts a bare slug (existing behavior pin).
 *   B) resolveParentPlan accepts an absolute path.
 *   C) resolveParentPlan accepts a relative path.
 *   D) Followup can claim ownership of a plan folder that was
 *      previously owned by sf_team_auto / sf_team_plan /
 *      sf_team_implement / sf_team_task.
 *   E) Followup_resume still enforces ownership (no accidental
 *      cross-tool resume).
