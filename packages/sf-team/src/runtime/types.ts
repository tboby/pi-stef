/**
 * Public types for the fh-team agent runtime.
 *
 * `TeamMember` is the static description of an agent (role + model + skills).
 * `AgentRun` is the execution record produced by `spawnAgent`. The orchestrator
 * inspects `state`, `events`, `toolCalls`, and `finalText` to drive the review
 * loop forward. Process-group cleanup on abort is handled by `killTree` —
 * `parentPid` and `childPids` are diagnostic-only (best-effort, may be empty
 * in restricted sandboxes; cleanup never depends on them).
