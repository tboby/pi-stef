/**
 * Detect the package manager the worktree expects.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `package.json#packageManager` (Corepack standard, e.g. `npm@10.2.0`,
 *      `pnpm@9.0.0`, `yarn@4.0.0`, `bun@1.1.0`). When set we trust it
 *      regardless of which lockfiles happen to be present, since the
 *      author has explicitly declared their PM. The check order below
 *      is incidental — `pnpm`/`npm`/`yarn`/`bun` prefixes don't collide.
 *   2. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at the worktree root → pnpm. pnpm uses
 *      this file to declare workspaces; its presence is a strong
 *      pnpm-only signal even if no lockfile has been committed yet.
 *   3. Lockfile detection at the worktree root, in this priority order:
 *      `pnpm-lock.yaml` > `yarn.lock` > `bun.lock` (Bun ≥1.2 default,
 *      Jan 2025+) > `bun.lockb` (Bun ≤1.1 binary) > `package-lock.json`.
 *      Pnpm is checked first so ambiguous multi-PM repos resolve to the
 *      same default they did before this detector existed.
 *
 *      **Stale-pnpm-lock gate (added 2026-05-08):** the `pnpm-lock.yaml`
 *      step is SKIPPED when `package.json#workspaces` is non-empty. At
 *      this point step 2 has already returned pnpm if a real
 *      `pnpm-workspace.yaml` was present, so reaching step 3 with a
 *      non-empty `workspaces` field implies the canonical pnpm-monorepo
 *      declaration is missing. pnpm doesn't honor `package.json#workspaces`
 *      (it warns and ignores it), so the only way that combination
 *      occurs in a real pnpm project is if a stale `pnpm-lock.yaml` was
 *      left behind by an earlier tool run that ran `pnpm install` against
 *      an npm-style repo (verified live: cursor user 2026-05-08, weather-app
 *      worktree with 3 workspaces, both lockfiles, no pnpm-workspace.yaml,
 *      verification gate failed with `vitest: command not found` because
 *      pnpm install left workspace node_modules empty). Skipping the
 *      pnpm-lock step lets yarn.lock / bun.lock / package-lock.json
 *      still win at their own priority slots.
 *   4. `package.json#workspaces` (an npm/yarn-style array or object) →
 *      npm. Catches the case where neither yarn.lock nor bun.lock nor
 *      package-lock.json was present but the project clearly declares
 *      itself as an npm-style workspaces repo.
 *   5. Default `pnpm` — preserves prior behavior for repos without any
 *      detection signal (existing tests assume this).
