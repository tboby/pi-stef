/**
 * Summary-based payload composition for impl-review prompts.
 *
 * Background: prior to this module, `tools/implement.ts` passed the FULL
 * staged diff into the reviewer's prompt (round 1) and BOTH the prior diff
 * + the revised diff (round 2+). For a multi-file milestone the prompt
 * could exceed macOS ARG_MAX (~1 MB) — the OS rejected the spawn with
 * `E2BIG` before the reviewer subprocess could start, killing the entire
 * `fh_team_auto` run mid-milestone (the user's M2 round 2 in particular).
 *
 * The fix replaces full-diff payloads with bounded summaries:
 *   - Round 1: developer's narrative `finalText` + `git diff --staged --stat`.
 *   - Round 2+: original impl summary (round 1 verbatim) + prior verdict +
 *     current fix summary (round-N narrative + cumulative diff stat).
 *
 * Three byte caps are mechanically enforced via {@link truncateBytes}:
 *
 *   - {@link IMPL_FINAL_TEXT_CAP_BYTES} (16 KB) — the developer's narrative
 *   - {@link IMPL_DIFF_STAT_CAP_BYTES} (8 KB) — `git diff --staged --stat`
 *   - {@link IMPL_PRIOR_VERDICT_CAP_BYTES} (8 KB) — the prior reviewer verdict
 *
 * Total prompt is bounded at ~75 KB worst case
 * (originalImpl ≤ 24 KB + priorVerdict ≤ 8 KB + currentFix ≤ 24 KB +
 * structural template ≤ 5 KB). Comfortably below any OS argv limit.
 *
 * Truncation is BYTE-aware (not JS-string-length-aware) because the
 * developer's `finalText` typically contains multi-byte UTF-8 characters
 * (checkmarks ✓, em-dashes —, occasionally emoji). When a cap would split
 * a multi-byte sequence, `truncateBytes` rounds DOWN to the previous valid
 * UTF-8 boundary so the result is always valid UTF-8.
 *
 * The transcripts on disk are unchanged: every `<NNNN>-developer-impl-diff-
 * M<X>.md` still contains the full git diff body for human inspection. Only
 * the reviewer-prompt-composition pathway changes.

 * byte view; slicing by byte then decoding back via `toString("utf8")`
 * with the default `fatal: false` semantics replaces incomplete trailing
 * bytes with U+FFFD. We avoid that by walking BACKWARDS from the cap to
 * find a byte that is NOT a UTF-8 continuation byte (top bits `10xxxxxx`).
 * That byte position is the start of the next codepoint, so slicing the
