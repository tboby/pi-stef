## Package Management

Use the [catalog](packages/catalog/README.md) extension (`ct`) for declarative package management and cross-machine sync.

```bash
/ct add <source>              # Add a package (name auto-derived)
/ct remove <name>             # Remove a package
/ct enable <name>             # Enable a package
/ct disable <name>            # Disable a package
/ct sync                      # Sync with remote gist
/ct status                    # Show catalog status
```

See the [catalog README](packages/catalog/README.md) for the full command reference, `cat.yaml` format, and profile documentation.

## Install All

Use `ct sync` to install all catalog packages:

```bash
/ct sync
```

## Profiles & Sharing

### Pull your catalog from a gist

If you've already set up catalog sync (`/ct login` + `/ct sync`), your packages sync automatically via GitHub Gist. Use profiles to maintain different package sets for different machines:

```bash
/ct profile work --create    # Create a "work" profile
/ct profile work             # Switch to it
/ct add npm:@pi-stef/atlassian  # Add work-specific packages
/ct sync --profile work      # Sync this profile to its own gist
```

### Import someone else's catalog

To start from another person's catalog (e.g., a shared team setup):

```bash
/ct init --from-gist=<gist-id>
```

This replaces your entire local catalog with the contents of that gist, including any profiles it defines. After importing, run `/ct sync` to install all packages.

**How to find a gist ID:** The gist URL is `https://gist.github.com/<user>/<gist-id>`. The `<gist-id>` is the last part of the URL.

### Limitations

- `/ct init --from-gist` replaces your entire catalog — it does not merge or selectively import.
- There is no command to import a single profile from another user's gist. You can manually copy profile entries from their `cat.yaml` into yours.
- Each profile syncs to its own gist (described as `catalog-<profile-name>`). The gist cache stores only one ID at a time.

## Individual Install
